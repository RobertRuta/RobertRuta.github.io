## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This repository is configured to deploy automatically on pushes to `main` using GitHub Actions.

Requirements:
- In repository Settings â†’ Pages, set Source to "GitHub Actions".
- Ensure the default branch is `main` or `master`.

The workflow builds with `next build` (configured with `output: 'export'`) and publishes the `out/` directory to Pages.
